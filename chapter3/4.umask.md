### How does umask cooperate with 'open()' or 'creat()'?
Actually, when you call open() or creat() in c programs, 'mode' parameter will be attached with 'umask' using AND operator, if the final bit is true, then the related permission(s) will be removed from the final result. 

Of course, setting 'umask' value can't prevent 'chmod' system call / 'chmod' command.
